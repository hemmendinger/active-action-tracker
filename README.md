active-action-tracker
=====================

For tracking wtf you were doing and wth else you need to do next via the cli 
when in a project without breaking context, ADD-friendly.

Problem addressed/goal of project: 
    Adding or referencing a to-do list while working can be distracting, resulting
    in frequent tangents. Which is harmful to any programmer's focus and flow,
    and results in a depletion of precious time.

    This program will allow a programmer to add and signal completion of tasks. 
    Ideally, a task is broken down into independent action-able items, or actions,
    in the spirit of the 'GTD' system, and only a signal action from a queue of 
    actions being worked on until completion.
