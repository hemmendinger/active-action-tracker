FIFO queue
first action is the top of the queue and default current working action

actions performed by user:
adding an action
completing/deleting an action
print current working action

def add_action
    check if file exists
        if not, create file
    check if have permissions to read/write file
    open file for read/write
    write action to file
    save/close file
    print notification of add to stdout

def get_working_action
    # might load script into shell config and have this command run every time a prompt is created
    check if file exists
	if not, create
    check if have permissions to read
    open file for read
    get first line
    close file
    print first line to stdout

def delete_working_action
    check if have write permissions
    open file for read/write
    delete first line
    close file
    print new working action to stdout

def check_permissions

def open_file_create_tmp_file


future/after basic behaviors:
action hiearchy, making certain actions dependent upon the completion of one or more actions
shuffling through the queue, reversing it
assigning priority to actions
look for file in project root as defined by git
    utilizes 'git rev-parse --show-top-level' to get project root
add and change to new action (or expressed as add to top of queue)
