FIFO queue
first action is the top of the queue and default current working action

actions performed by user:
adding an action
completing/deleting an action
print current working action

future/after basic behaviors:
action hiearchy, making certain actions dependent upon the completion of one or more actions
shuffling through the queue, reversing it
assigning priority to actions
